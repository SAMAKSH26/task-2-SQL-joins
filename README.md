SQL joins are used when we have to join two or more tables data but requirement is that there should be atleast one common column between two tables through which tables are related .

types of joins : 

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

In this task , i created two tables customer and orders which are related by common attribute 'customer_id' and performs the various joins operations .


tool used : Sql server management system
